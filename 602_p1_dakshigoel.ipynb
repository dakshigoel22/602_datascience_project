        "\n",
        "The most significant potential confounding variable in this study is the prompt. The **content and complexity of the prompt** directly influence the linguistic features of the output text (the IVs). For example, a prompt asking for a \"poem in the style of Shakespeare\" will produce text with very different features than a prompt asking for a \"technical summary of a research paper.\" This influence is independent of which LLM is used. If one LLM in the dataset was predominantly used for creative prompts while another was used for technical ones, the model might incorrectly learn that \"poetic language\" is a feature of the first LLM, when it's actually a feature of the prompt's domain.\n",

        "\n",
        "Stratified Analysis: Ensure that the dataset was created by giving the exact same set of prompts to every LLM and the human writers. This design neutralizes the prompt as a confounder.\n",

        "Feature Engineering: If prompts are varied, they can be categorized (e.g., 'Creative', 'Technical', 'News'). This prompt category can then be included as a control variable in the model to account for its effect.\n",

A script, likely written in Python, was developed to systematically iterate through the list of 1000 prompts. For each prompt, the script sent API requests to each of the seven LLM endpoints (e.g., from OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks). The script would then parse the API responses and save the generated text, the original prompt, and the model's label into a structured format like a CSV file. This automated method ensures consistency and efficiency in collecting a large volume of text.\n",

Unlike the AI text, which was generated in response to the prompts, the human samples were pre-existing texts. For each prompt extracted from a source like the Reuters corpus, the original article itself served as the corresponding \"human\" text. This approach ensures that the human writing is authentic and topically aligned with the prompts given to the LLMs.\n",

        "1. **Quality :** The dataset's primary strength is its use of a broad array of powerful and relevant LLMs, including ChatGLM, Dolly, ChatGPT-turbo, GPT4All, StableLM, and Claude. In a rapidly evolving field, using a dataset with state-of-the-art models ensures the research findings are timely and applicable to the current technological landscape. Other dataset includes the TuringTest Benchmark dataset, but it was last updated in 2021, contains outdated LLMs and does not consist of information about prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Consistency :** The dataset provides both human-written and AI-generated text for the same set of prompts. This parallel structure is a critical feature for a methodologically sound comparison. By having every author respond to the same prompt, the dataset design isolates the author's unique style as the key variable under investigation. This minimizes the influence of the prompt's topic, which would otherwise act as a significant confounding variable, ensuring a fair comparison of each author's stylistic fingerprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Variety :** The prompts are consistently sourced from three distinct domains: essays, Wikipedia articles, and Reuters news reports. This enables a deeper analysis of how stylistic markers might vary across different contexts, directly supporting the investigation of hypotheses related to domain influence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "However, at the same time, it is also important to address the limitations of the MGT BENCH dataset, particularly the lack of information on prompts and generation parameters. For this study, I am assuming that the parameters are kept similar across models and across prompts."

That is not to say competition is absent, but it is organised competition,\\\" said Francois Logerot, author of the Cour des Comptes (court of auditors') report.\\n\\\"It may be that concentration in this sector is accentuated by agreements between these companies...sometimes by creating joint subsidiaries at the request of local councils.\\\"\\nLogerot cited as an example the Saint-Etienne city council, where the water company Societe Stephanoise des Eaux is jointly owned by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez and Generale des Eaux (CGE).\\nThe report, presented at a news conference, said the private sector held 75 percent of the supply of drinking water in France in 1991, up from 60 percent in 1980 and 31 percent in 1954.\\nThe price of water rose by a national average 47.7 percent from 1990 to 1994, it said.\\nSignificant price rises occurred where contracts were awarded to the private sector, Logerot said.\\n\\\"Sometimes there was a catch-up effect but there were also excesses and abnormal situations.\\\"\\nBut CGE noted in a statement that the report said the main reason for rising water prices was higher quality and increasing investment needs.\\nIt said the official audit pointed to a near doubling of the cost of water treatment between 1990 and 1995, while the price to the consumer rose by 30 percent.\\nLogerot said local authorities often awarded contracts to the water companies in exchange for payments which the companies then recovered in the price charged to customers.\\nThe study followed a 1995 law which banned \\\"right of entry\\\" payments that water companies paid to win an operating licence.\\nThe report cited the Alpine city of Grenoble, where a contract with Lyonnaise des Eaux resulted in the conviction for bribery of the mayor, former Gaullist minister Alain Carignon.\\nGrenoble used the proceeds of the water contract to finance its general expenditure, while accounting principles call for water expenses to be kept separate from the general budget.\\nLyonnaise said in a statement that each water company had given details of its contracts to the audit office and, of the 12,000 in France, only about 20 had drawn explicit comment. And these had been agreed under conditions prevailing before the 1995 law.\\nThe CGE statement said much of the criticism in the report related to the past, when payment for contracts was legal. It added that the company was pleased such payments had been banned and the duration of those contracts was limited.\\nCGE said the water market was highly competitive and 1996 had shown that, when contracts expired, there was competition to win new licences. The sector was also subject to strict controls by a number of public bodies, including competition and quality experts.\",\n          \"Shares in British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) rose strongly on Monday after the pay television operator cleared a key regulatory hurdle and amid reports it planned to push ahead and launch digital services in Britain next year.\\nBSkyB shares added 19p to 495-1/2p by early afternoon, reversing a downward pattern which has seen them shed almost two pounds ($3.3) since mid-October.\\nThe rise was fuelled by an announcement from Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) that it had accepted BSkyB's new terms for the supply of its channels to cable operators.\\nThe stock had earlier been boosted by a report in the Financial Times that BSkyB, 40 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, was poised to order the set-top boxes required to receive its digital satellite services.\\n\\\"The news flow has been positive and some funds which are underweight in BSkyB have been taking the opportunity to buy,\\\" said Anthony de Larrinaga of broker Panmure Gordon, commenting on the price rise.\\nHowever, he injected a note of caution.\\n\\\"We still have to see the performance for dish sales in the run-up to Christmas. The decision to push ahead with digital may be partly a reflection of weaker analogue sales,\\\" he added.\\nThe OFT approved BSkyB's revised \\\"rate card\\\" -- setting out the pricing and structure for the supply of satellite channels to cable operators.\\n\\\"The changes increase the flexibility of cable operators in marketing their services,\\\" OFT Director General John Bridgeman said in a statement.\\nBut the cable industry criticised the decision and vowed to continue its fight. One option is to take the issue to the European Commission.\\n\\\"We fail to see how today's announcement is in the consumers' interest,\\\" the Cable Communications Association said in a statement.\\nBSkyB, which supplies a diet of top-quality sport and Hollywood movies, has more than five million subscribers -- 3.3 million receiving the service via a satellite dish and almost 1.9 million on cable.\\nBSkyB's shares have fallen from highs in the last two months because of regulatory concerns in Britain and worries over the apparent slow take-up of the digital services of Germany's DF1, in which BSkyB and Kirch Group are partners.\\nBSkyB has announced plans to launch digital satellite services supplying some 200 channels into Britain late next year but recent reports had suggested that it could delay the launch.\\nBut the Financial Times quoted Murdoch as saying that BSkyB will go ahead with a decoder box concentrating on new channels plus pay-per-view sport and films. A decoder offering access to interactive services such as home shopping would follow later.\\n\\\"Now I think we will go with a straight simple box and have a second-generation box a year later.

Ofcom, the media watchdog, has opened up applications for new television channels which will use digital terrestrial technology to broadcast their content. The move to digital technology promises better picture and sound quality, more reliable reception, and more programming choices for viewers.\\nThe channels will be known as \\\"local television\\\" and they will be available in cities and towns across the UK. Ofcom has identified 34 areas where the new channels can be launched. The channels will cater to local audiences, with programming tailored to the interests and needs of the communities they serve.\\nThe new local television channels will be made possible by the creation of a new multiplex, or group of frequencies, that will be used exclusively for digital terrestrial television. Ofcom has licensed the company Comux UK to operate the multiplex, which will provide the infrastructure for the new channels.\\nComux UK is a non-profit company that was created specifically to operate the multiplex. It will be responsible for the technical aspects of the new television service, including the transmission of signals and the provision of back-up facilities in the event of technical failure.\\nOfcom expects the new local television channels to be launched in 2013. The watchdog has set out a number of criteria for the new channels, including a requirement that they offer at least four hours of original programming per day, including local news and current affairs. Ofcom has also said that the channels must be financially viable and sustainable, with revenue sources from advertising and other sources.\\nOfcom has also said that it will be looking for applications from a range of potential operators, including existing television broadcasters, local and community groups, and new entrants to the market. The watchdog has encouraged potential applicants to be innovative and creative in their proposals, and to demonstrate that they have a strong understanding of the needs of their local communities.\\nThe move to digital terrestrial television reflects a wider trend in the UK television industry. In recent years, there has been a marked shift away from traditional analogue broadcasting towards digital technologies. This has been driven by improvements in technology and changes in viewer habits, with more people turning to digital platforms such as on-demand services and streaming sites like Netflix.\\nThe move to digital television also reflects a desire to address the needs of local communities. With the rise of national and international media, there has been a concern that local news and information is being overlooked. By creating new local television channels, Ofcom hopes to foster greater engagement and participation in local communities, and to ensure that local voices are heard.\\nOverall, the move to digital terrestrial television represents a major shift in the UK television industry. With the launch of the new local television channels, viewers can expect a greater choice of programming, improved picture and sound quality, and a more reliable television service. For communities across the UK, the new channels offer an opportunity to engage with local issues and to have their voices heard.\",\n          \"The UK government has announced that it will not provide tax credits to British utilities for share buybacks and special dividends.\\nThis decision comes after months of debate and discussion among industry experts and policymakers.

The remaining debt will continue to accrue interest, although at a lower rate. Eurotunnel also received an extension on loan maturities but no reduction in principal amounts owed.\\n\\nThe restructuring plan allows Eurotunnel to avoid default on its loans and bonds but fails to significantly improve the company's debt woes. Net debt still stands at over \\u20ac9 billion, nearly five times the company's market capitalization. Interest expenses will remain high, diverting funds away from investment and transition projects. The modest debt relief also means Eurotunnel's debt levels will likely remain a concern for ratings agencies and investors.\\n\\nEurotunnel CEO Jacques Gounon expressed disappointment with the terms of the deal. However, he stated that the restructuring provides greater financial flexibility and stability for the company to improve operations and revenue. Traffic volume through the Channel Tunnel rose 4% last year and fares were increased. Revenue growth and cost cutting measures are expected to help Eurotunnel strengthen its financial position over time despite the limited debt restructuring.\\n\\nInvestors reacted negatively to the announcement, driving Eurotunnel's share price down 38% over the past 12 months. Despite the operational improvements, Eurotunnel remains heavily indebted and vulnerable to economic slowdowns. The limited debt relief under the restructuring plan appears to have rattled investor confidence in the company's ability to substantially improve its financial health in the coming years. Eurotunnel's long journey to achieve a sustainable capital structure seems far from over following this month's disappointing deal with its banks.

However, analysts had forecast slightly higher growth of 18 percent, leaving investors disappointed. News Corp's share price dipped 3 percent in early trading following the announcement.\\n\\nThe media conglomerate reported net income of $1.23 billion for the quarter ending September 30, up from $1.06 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose 15 percent to $0.21. Revenue increased 11 percent to $9.98 billion, driven by strong growth in the company's cable network programming and filmed entertainment divisions.\\n\\nHowever, analysts had expected revenue of $10.05 billion and earnings per share of $0.22 based on Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch's prediction of 20 percent growth in News Corp's net profit this fiscal year. Mr. Murdoch said he remained confident the full-year results would meet targets, attributing the lower-than-expected first quarter figures to the timing of new digital product launches and the costs of acquisitions made earlier this year.\\n\\n\\\"We are poised for another strong year of revenue and profit growth, despite this quarter's results,\\\" said Mr. Murdoch in a statement. \\\"The expansion of our video offerings will accelerate in the coming months with new streaming services and the launch of additional channels, which will drive subscription and advertising revenue growth across our properties.\\\"  \\n\\nNews Corp's cable network programming division was a bright spot, with operating income up 17 percent to $1.43 billion on higher affiliate and advertising fees for the Fox News Channel and FX Networks. Revenue from the filmed entertainment division grew 12 percent to $2.97 billion due to the theatrical success of blockbusters like Bohemian Rhapsody and The Favourite.   \\n\\nHowever, News Corp's print newspaper business continued its long-term decline. Revenue dropped 9 percent to $1.18 billion in the first quarter, largely due to falling print advertising and circulation sales in News Corp's Australian and U.K. mastheads. Mr. Murdoch has repeatedly pledged to stop subsidizing loss-making newspapers, but has so far delayed shuttering The Sun and The Times in Britain.   \\n\\n(continued in the comments)\",\n          \"Justice Department seeks Supreme Court intervention to lift suspension on federal rules for local telephone competition\\n\\nThe Justice Department asked the Supreme Court today to intervene and lift a suspension on federal rules intended to boost competition in local telephone service. The department argues that the suspension of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is costing Americans money and limiting choice. \\n\\nA federal appeals court in Washington, DC suspended several key provisions of the landmark telecommunications law last year after telecom companies argued that certain rules were unfair or technologically unfeasible. The rules were meant to open the $300-billion local phone service market to competition by requiring companies that own the lines into homes and businesses to lease them to rivals at discounted rates.\\n\\nThe Justice Department petitioned the Supreme Court to vacate the lower court's decision, arguing that Americans have lost more than $5 billion in savings and fees as a result of the suspension. \\u201cThe longer these pro-competitive rules remain suspended, the longer American consumers will be denied choice and lower prices that Congress promised them,\\u201d the department said in a statement.\\n\\nThe rules in question mandate that regional Bell phone companies lease their lines to competitors at discounted rates and resell parts of their network at wholesale prices. The companies argue that the rules amount to unreasonable government intervention that limits their ability to profit from their infrastructure investments.\\n\\nSince the law's passage, the Bells have resisted lowering fees for access to their networks, sparking a series of legal battles and delays in dozens of states. Consumer advocates claim that the Bells have engaged in anti-competitive practices to maintain their monopolies as long as possible. The Bells counter that they should not have to subsidize private companies use of their property to turn profits. \\n\\nWhile the court battle plays out, many states have abandoned or loosened local phone competition rules. Some critics argue this significantly weakens the potential benefits to consumers, while proponents claim that deregulation spurs investment in new infrastructure. There is no consensus on the impact so far to consumers in terms of choice, fees, and service.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court must now decide whether to take up the Justice Department\\u2019s petition. If it does, a ruling would provide clarity for both sides of the telecom policy debate as well as for state regulators grappling with competition laws. The court may also opt to return the issue to lower courts for reconsideration. For now, competition in local telephone service remains stalled in much of the country. Overall, the shape of the U.S. telecommunications system hangs in the balance as this legal fight drags on.\",\n          \"London-based pharmaceutical company SkyePharma has predicted that 1998 will be a \\u201cmagic year\\u201d of growth for its investors and shareholders, thanks to a number of upcoming product launches and partnerships.\\nSkyePharma has a strong track record of developing and commercializing innovative drug delivery technologies, including inhalation and oral formulations.
